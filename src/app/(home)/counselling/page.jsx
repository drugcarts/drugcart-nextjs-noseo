                        <p className="my-2"> Counseling today plays a very important role in the well being of an individual patients hearing the problems and ending their life, just because they cannot deal with their stress and frustration.</p>
                        <p className="my-2"> It is important to know that counselors can approach anyone and completely up on them with complete confidentiality.</p>
                        <p className="my-2"> Absolutely often people run away for the recommendation of a counselor, as that people believe that counseling is only for emergency situation, but they won’t notice that counseling can help with being as simple as reaching a goal.</p>
                        <p className="my-2"> A counselor offers a helping hand to people who come to them ignoring of their needs and pull them out of their mental weakness.</p>
                        <p className="my-2"> Moreover it is better to find a help rather than keep quiet and suffer.</p>
                        <p className="my-2"> You always choose to stop the counseling when you feel you are fine and made recovery.</p>
                        <p className="my-2"> There is no compulsion to continue with the counseling session when you find yourself mentally fit to lead to happy and stress free life.</p>
